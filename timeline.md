## Software Development Timeline (Engineering Track)

Assumptions
- 2-week sprints; rolling weekly deploys for web, bi-weekly for app.
- Team: 3 full‑stack, 1 mobile (RN), 1 QA, 1 DevOps (ref. Project.md 7.1).
- Scope aligns with MVP “must‑have” in Project.md 6.1 and Business Requirements Feature 6–10, 14.
- Security, performance, and analytics are treated as first‑class and run in parallel.

Q1 2024 — Foundations
- Infra/DevOps: Monorepo + CI/CD, Docker, basic IaC, env management, observability baseline.
- Backend/API: Express TS scaffold, error model, DTO validation, auth (signup/login/refresh), rate limiting.
- Data: Prisma schema for Users/Products/Orders/Cart; initial migrations and seed data.
- Web: Next.js app shell, routing, design tokens, core layout/header/cart icon.
- Mobile: RN bootstrap, navigation, theming, crash/perf SDKs; store listing prep.
- Security: Secret scanning, dependency checks, headers/CSP baseline; privacy policy drafts.
- Analytics: Event taxonomy finalization; SDK wrappers; basic dashboards skeleton.

Q2 2024 — MVP (Launch)
- Backend/API: Catalog (PLP/PDP), Cart/Pricing, Address & Shipping, Orders lifecycle (created/paid), Payments intents + webhooks.
- Web: PLP, PDP, Cart, Checkout, Account (orders/addresses); performance budgets; SEO basics.
- Mobile: Read‑only browse/PDP, auth, cart; staged beta via internal tracks.
- Admin (minimal): Price/inventory edits, order view, simple refunds export.
- DevOps: Blue/green deploys, alarms, runbooks; WAF/rate limits; backups and restores tested.
- QA: E2E smoke for browse→PDP→cart→checkout; load test of hot paths; accessibility baseline.
- Analytics: Purchase funnels, error/latency monitors; KPI dashboards live.

Q3 2024 — Retention & Scale
- Backend/API: Subscriptions v1, referrals/loyalty, reviews & UGC with moderation, search synonyms/fuzzy.
- Web: Subscriptions flows, loyalty UI, reviews; performance tuning and CWV hardening.
- Mobile: Cart/checkout parity; push notifications and deep links.
- Admin: Promotions/coupons, bulk uploads, basic RBAC and audit.
- Data: ETL to warehouse (dbt v1), retention cohorts; alerting on CR dips and payment failures.
- SRE: Synthetic checks, error budget policy; capacity tuning.

Q4 2024 — Scale Features
- Backend/API: Influencer marketplace pilot endpoints; feature hardening; fraud/risk scoring hooks.
- Web/Mobile: Creator marketplace UI pilot; SEO pillar pages; reviews enhancements.
- Admin: Catalog workflows (bulk adjust, reservations), returns approvals.
- SRE/Sec: Pen‑test remediations, WAF tuning; DR drill; cost guardrails.

Q1 2025 — Community & Intl Prep
- Backend/API: Forums/gamification services; notifications center; i18n scaffolding.
- Web/Mobile: Community v1 UX; moderation tools; performance budgets maintained.
- Data: Community engagement dashboards; A/B infra for experiments.
- Ops: Tax/GST reports hardening; returns/RMA refinements.

Q2 2025 — Launch Community & Intl Pilot
- Community launch with moderation workflows and notifications.
- International shipping pilot plumbing; duties/taxes & address validation.
- Multi‑region readiness (read replica plan), improved incident automation.

MVP Critical Path (Q1→Q2 2024)
- Gate A (Q1 W4): CI/CD, envs, schema baseline, auth ready.
- Gate B (Q2 W4): Checkout with payments + webhooks stabilized; Admin minimal live.
- Gate C (Q2 W6): Perf (P75 < 2.0s web), crash‑free > 99.5% (app beta), security checklist.
- Gate D (Q2 W8–10): Beta + bug bash + staged rollout; go‑live.

Risks & Mitigations
- Payments onboarding/approvals can slip 2–3 weeks → start early; sandbox parity and fallbacks.
- App store review variability → keep web primary for Day‑0, app staged beta.
- Subscriptions/loyalty complexity → isolate as Q3 feature flags; defer if MVP dates at risk.
- Admin scope creep → enforce “minimal ops” for MVP; expand in Q3.
