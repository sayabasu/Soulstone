  - Roles: anonymous, customer, staff, admin.

- Versioning & stability:
  - GraphQL: additive changes only in minor; deprecations flagged for ≥2 release cycles.
  - REST: prefix with `/v1`; breaking changes only in major; sunset headers on deprecations.

  - Subscriptions: `createSubscription`, `pause/resume`, `cancel`, `billingHistory`.
  - Content: `articles`, `articleBySlug`, `search(query, facets)`.

- REST endpoints (selected):
  - `POST /v1/auth/login`, `POST /v1/auth/refresh`, `POST /v1/auth/logout`.
  - `POST /v1/payments/razorpay/intent` → returns `order_id`, amount, currency.
  - `POST /v1/webhooks/razorpay` (HMAC‑SHA256 signature header) — idempotent, 5 retries (expo backoff).
