# Terraform Infrastructure

This directory will house reusable Terraform modules and environment definitions. Modules should be organized by component (e.g., networking, database, observability) and environments should consume those modules via composition. Refer to `docs/onboarding.md` for instructions on authenticating to AWS before running Terraform commands.
